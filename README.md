# Python Coding Practices
Small code blocks from my learning process

- ATM code created in "Turkish" language but it is understandable
- Perfect Number Program: You may find the definition of a perfect number at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_number)
- Calculator: Still have problems, it will be better in time
- Read_Number_Function: It returns the English pronunciation of the input integer value.
- Armstrong_Number: Please see following link to get information about [Armstrong Number](https://www.quora.com/What-is-an-Armstrong-number)
- Shape_Geometry_Program: Please check mathematical explanations of [Triangle](https://tutorme.com/blog/post/triangle-rules/) and [Quadrilateral](https://e-gmat.com/blogs/quadrilateral-properties-formulas-rectangle-square-parallelogram-rhombus-trapezium-trapezoid/)
- Username_Password_Portal: It is a simple code block for login. I've also added an attempt feature to prevent too many attempts for login.
- Pythagorean_Theorem: Two seperate code block has been added one of them for [Hypotenuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypotenuse) other for [Special Right Triangles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_right_triangle)
